// Our first session! Very basic hello world.

#include <stdio.h> // This is the library file that lets you use printf

int main () { // this is our main function, where our program will start execution
  printf("Hello world!\n"); // Printf is short for formatted print, which means that you can print the value of variables using special syntax.
                            // For now, let's just print Hello World!
}
